# closedutils

The [cool kids were playing in a repo](https://github.com/jeszy75/rangeutils), so [I wanted to play too](https://youtu.be/hWFzfQs7vmk?t=40).

Essentially I just wanted to make `rangeutils`, but as generic, with convex hull and a properly represented `empty`.

The things listed below are more valuable than any of my nonsense:

- [Interval Comparisons and Lattice Operations based on the Interval Overlapping Relation](https://grouper.ieee.org/groups/1788/PositionPapers/overlapping.pdf)
- [ITF1788 â€“ Interval Test Framework for IEEE Std 1788-2015](https://github.com/oheim/ITF1788)
- [Ordering, posets, recipes etc.](https://youtu.be/Cf3tsAeGhBg?t=480)
